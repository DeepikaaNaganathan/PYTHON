Hi mam. 
Git hub is a website, and Git hub uses git , Git is a version control system. 
We can develop our coding skills practically in Git .
What I understood from this git hub is,
If we had a team of 7 members each may be in different areas they can do their work in their own places
and one maintainer will arrange everything and the separate block of functions will turn into a project or a software.
The team members can edit the code and look into ot and get correct it. This is what I understood about Git
