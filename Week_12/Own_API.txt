        though we have google to search if it is separately like google maps ....If we have separatly for hotels it will be helpful for foodies 

For_turning_of_motor - used for indication that the motor should be turnred of within 5 mins so that the user could know about the water level 
                       and for turning it on before it touches the 0th level
